Check out this __[Unsupervised Learning project](https://github.com/avelicha/Unsupervised_Learning_DSND_Identify_Customer_Segments/blob/master/identify_customer_segments_git.ipynb)__ I worked on as part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. In this project, I developed an Image Classifier with PyTorch recognize different species of flowers.
