Check out this __[Unsupervised Learning project](https://github.com/avelicha/Unsupervised_Learning_DSND_Identify_Customer_Segments/blob/master/identify_customer_segments_git.ipynb)__ I worked on as part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. In this project, I worked with real-life data provided by Udacity's Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. My job as a data scientist was to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
