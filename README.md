Check out this __[Unsupervised Learning project](https://github.com/avelicha/Unsupervised_Learning_DSND_Identify_Customer_Segments/blob/master/identify_customer_segments_git.ipynb)__ I worked on as part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. In this project, I worked with real-life data provided by Udacity's Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest was to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. My job as a data scientist was to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, I assessed and cleaned the data in order to convert it into a usable form.
